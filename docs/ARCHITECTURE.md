# ARCHITECTURE

## System Architecture Overview

This WordPress template project follows a containerized, modular architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and developer productivity.

## Core Components

### Container Layer

- **Custom Docker Image**: Built from official PHP-FPM base with WordPress-specific optimizations
- **Web Server**: Nginx configured for optimal WordPress performance
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB with persistent storage
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for object caching and session management
- **Mail Service**: Local mail catcher for development

### Application Layer

- **WordPress Core**: Latest stable version with security patches
- **Custom Theme**: Built with modern PHP standards and responsive design
- **Plugin Architecture**: Modular plugin system for extensibility
- **API Layer**: WordPress REST API with custom endpoints

### Data Layer

- **Database Persistence**: Local MySQL storage in `/database` directory
- **File Storage**: WordPress uploads and media files
- **Configuration**: Environment-based settings management
- **Backup System**: Automated database and file backups

## Directory Structure Philosophy

### Separation of Concerns

- **Application Code**: WordPress installation isolated in dedicated directory
- **Configuration**: Environment and Docker configs separated from application
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs in dedicated folder
- **Data**: Persistent data stored outside application directory

### Development Environment

- **Hot Reloading**: File changes reflected immediately
- **Debug Mode**: Enhanced error reporting and logging
- **Development Tools**: Built-in debugging and profiling tools
- **Testing Environment**: Isolated testing configuration
